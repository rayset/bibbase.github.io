abstract = {White-light continuum (WLC) generation in bulk media finds numerous applications in ultrafast optics and spectroscopy. Due to the complexity of the underlying spatiotemporal dynamics, WLC optimization typically follows empirical procedures. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning dealing with the control of automated systems using deep neural networks. In this Letter, we demonstrate the capability of a deep RL agent to generate a long-term-stable WLC from a bulk medium without any previous knowledge of the system dynamics or functioning. This work demonstrates that RL can be exploited effectively to control complex nonlinear optical experiments.},

abstract={In the last few years, with the exponential diffusion of smartphones, services for turn-by-turn navigation have seen a surge in popularity. Current solutions available in the market allow the user to select via an interface the desired transportation mode, for which an optimal route is then computed. Automatically recognizing the transportation system that the user is travelling by allows to dynamically control, and consequently update, the route proposed to the user. Such a dynamic approach is an enabling technology for multi-modal transportation planners, in which the optimal path and its associated transportation solutions are updated in real-time based on data coming from (i) distributed sensors (e.g., smart traffic lights, road congestion sensors, etc.); (ii) service providers (e.g., car-sharing availability, bus waiting time, etc.); and (iii) the user’s own device, in compliance with the development of smart cities envisaged by the 5G architecture. In this paper, we present a series of Machine Learning approaches for real-time Transportation Mode Recognition and we report their performance difference in our field tests. Several Machine Learning-based classifiers, including Deep Neural Networks, built on both statistical feature extraction and raw data analysis are presented and compared in this paper; the result analysis also highlights which features are proven to be the most informative ones for the classification. © 2020 by the authors.

End users will experience the impression of being surrounded by a distributed computer, fulfilling their requests with apparently zero latency. In this paper, we consider an architecture that provides communication, computation, and caching (C3) services on demand, anytime, and everywhere in 3D space, integrating conventional ground (terrestrial) base stations and flying (non-terrestrial) nodes. Given the complexity of the overall network, the C3 resources and management of aerial devices need to be jointly orchestrated via artificial intelligence-based algorithms, exploiting virtualized network functions dynamically deployed in a distributed manner across terrestrial and non-terrestrial nodes. © 2020 ETRI},

The present work addresses this problem and presents a user-aware resource allocation methodology for heterogeneous networks. Said methodology is articulated in two-steps: at first, the Analytical Hierarchy Process is used for deciding the network over which traffic is steered and, then, a Cooperative Game for allocating resources within the network is set up.

The core of the EMPC algorithm is a nonconvex optimization problem integrating the ESSs dynamics, the topological and power technical constraints of the grid, and the modeling of the cascading effects of potential adverse events. An equivalent (i.e., having the same optimal solution) proxy of the nonconvex problem is proposed to make the solution more tractable.

abstract={This letter proposes a lexicographic Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL)-based approach to chance-constrained Markov Decision Processes, in which the controller seeks to ensure that the probability of satisfying the constraint is above a given threshold. Standard DeepRL approaches require i) the constraints to be included as additional weighted terms in the cost function, in a multi-objective fashion, and ii) the tuning of the introduced weights during the training phase of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) according to the probability thresholds. The proposed approach, instead, requires to separately train one constraint-free DNN and one DNN associated to each constraint and then, at each time-step, to select which DNN to use depending on the system observed state. The presented solution does not require any hyper-parameter tuning besides the standard DNN ones, even if the probability thresholds changes. A lexicographic version of the well-known DeepRL algorithm DQN is also proposed and validated via simulations. © 2017 IEEE.},

art_number={061305},
abstract={Broadband Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (B-CARS) is a powerful label-free nonlinear spectroscopy technique allowing one to measure the full vibrational spectrum of molecules and solids. B-CARS spectra, however, suffer from the presence of a spurious signal, called non-resonant background (NRB), which interferes with the resonant vibrational one, distorting the line shapes and degrading the chemical information. While several numerical techniques are available to remove this unwanted contribution and extract the resonant vibrational signal of interest, they all require the user's intervention and sensitively depend on the spectral shape of the NRB, which needs to be measured independently. In this work, we present a novel approach to remove NRB from B-CARS spectra based on deep learning. Thanks to the high generalization capability offered by the deep architecture of the designed neural network, trained through realistic simulated spectra, our fully automated model is able to process B-CARS spectra in real time and independently of the detailed shape of the NRB spectrum. This results in fast extraction of vibrational spectra without requiring user intervention or the measurement of reference spectra. We expect that this model will significantly simplify and speed-up the analysis of B-CARS spectra in spectroscopy and microscopy. © 2020 Author(s).},

Under mild assumptions on the latency functions which describe the cost associated to the network paths, two algorithms are proposed: the former assumes that each commodity relies only on measurements of the latencies associated to its own paths; the latter assumes that each commodity has (at least indirectly) access to the measures of the latencies of all the network paths. Both algorithms are proven to drive the system state to an invariant set which approximates and contains the Wardrop equilibrium, defined as a network state in which no traffic flow over the network paths can improve its routing unilaterally, with the latter achieving a better reconstruction of the Wardrop equilibrium. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The deep integration between the cyber and physical domains in complex systems make very challenging the security evaluation process, as security itself is more of a concept (i.e., a subjective property) than a quantifiable characteristic. Traditional security assessing mostly relies on the personal skills of security experts, often based on best practices and personal experience. The present work is aimed at defining a security metric allowing evaluators to assess the security level of complex cyber-physical systems (CPSs), as critical infrastructures, in a holistic, consistent and repeatable way. To achieve this result, the mathematical framework provided by the open source security testing methodology manual (OSSTMM) is used as the backbone of the new security metric, since it allows to provide security indicators capturing, in a non-biased way, the security level of a system. Several concepts, as component lifecycle, vulnerability criticality and damage potential – effort ratio are embedded in the new security metric framework, developed in the scope of the H2020 project ATENA.

This article presents an economic model predictive control approach to the problem of managing the electric and heating resources in a smart building in a coordinated way, for the purpose of achieving in real time nearly zero energy consumption and automated participation to demand response programs. The proposed control, leveraging a mixed integer quadratic programming problem, allows to meet manifold thermal and electric users' requirements and react to inbound demand response signals, while still guaranteeing stable operation of the building's electric and thermal storage equipment. The simulation results, performed for a real case study in Italy, highlight the peculiarities of the proposed approach in the joint handling of electric and thermal building flexibility. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Residential and non-residential buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the EU. Considering that almost 75% of the building stock in EU is energy inefficient, the European energy policy promotes the improvement of the energy performance of existing buildings by introducing the innovative model of nearly zero energy building (nZEB). In the nZEB model, local energy sources (generation, storage and load management), building automation (BACS) and electronic monitoring of technical building systems (TBS) play a fundamental role. In electric systems, smart grids are a key feature of future energy scenarios, with the overarching goal of better aligning energy generation and demand. The challenge is the role of the users. The nZEB model with its “smart microgrid” can represent an effective driver according to the new policies of user's aggregation. In this framework demand side management (DSM) strategies can be implemented. The paper presents an innovative approach to use BACS present in nZEBS not only to increase the efficiency of TBS but also to operate an energy storage by heating systems for DSM strategies. © 2018 IEEE},

The algorithm is proven to converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a specific equilibrium among the loads of the providers, known as Wardrop equilibrium. Thanks to its characteristics, the algorithm is suitable for the software-defined networking (SDN) scenario, where service requests coming from the network nodes, i.e., the switches, are managed by the so-called SDN controllers, playing the role of providers. The proposed approach is aimed at dynamically balancing the requests of the switches among the SDN controllers to avoid congestion. This paper also suggests the adoption of SDN Proxies to improve the scalability of the overall SDN paradigm and presents an implementation of the algorithm in a proof-of-concept SDN scenario, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed solution with respect to the current approaches.

To this end, we propose a security framework and advanced tools to properly manage vulnerabilities, and to timely react to the threats.

The physical layers connected to Industrial Control Systems are prone to disrupt when facing cyber-attacks. Considering the modules of the proposed architecture, we focus on the development of a practical framework to compare information about physical faults and cyber-attacks.

An exact mapping algorithm in line with the current state of the art and based on integer linear programming is proposed as well, and the performances of the two algorithms are compared. While most of the current works in literature report exact or heuristic mapping methods, the RL algorithm presented here is instead a stochastic one, based on Markov decision processes theory. The aim of the RL algorithm is to iteratively learn an efficient mapping policy, which could maximize the expected mapping reward in the long run. Based on the review of the state of the art, the paper presents a general model of the service mapping problem and the mathematical formulation of the 2 proposed strategies.
